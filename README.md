# TTS-Google-Music-restart
 Restart music after Google announcement

Hello everyone ! sorry for my English ! 
And this is my first repositories.
I hope this helps you.

This repository allows you to add script launches to your Google Ads automations (e.g., doorbell announcement) to save and then replay the music in the state it was in before the ad (track played, volume, position).

You need to create two scripts that will be called in the TTS automation :
    - script_save_playing
    - script_restore_playing
After, add in automation script calls before and after sending TTS (with a delay) (like cript_add_automation example)

prerequisites: 
    - Spotcast last version (HACS)
    - Spotify premium

Enjoy
