# TTS-Google-Music-restart
 Restart music after Google announcement

Hello everyone ! sorry for my English ! 
And this is my first repositories.
I hope this helps you.

This repository allows you to add script launches to your Google Ads automations (e.g., doorbell announcement) to save and then replay the music in the state it was in before the ad (track played, volume, position).

Enjoy
